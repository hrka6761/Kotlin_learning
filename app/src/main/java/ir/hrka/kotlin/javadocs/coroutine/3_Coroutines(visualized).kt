/**
 * * In the Concurrent programming, we can serve the Coroutines To execute multi task simultaneously and independently of each other.
 * * Coroutines = cooperative routines (cooperative functions).
 * * Coroutines are lightweight, user-level constructs managed by the programming language runtime.
 * * Coroutines can be thought of as light-weight threads (Coroutines are less resource-intensive than JVM threads).
 *    * They are much more memory-efficient, often requiring only a small memory overhead for their stack.
 *    * You can have thousands (or even millions) of coroutines running concurrently.
 * * Coroutines are non-blocking and suspend execution voluntarily without kernel intervention.
 * * Coroutines run within threads and donâ€™t achieve parallelism (parallel programming) unless explicitly distributed across threads.
 * * Coroutines may not be available in all languages (e.g., native support in Kotlin, Python, etc.).
 * * In the following codes, i run some task in another Coroutine but in the main thread.
 * ```
 *     fun main() {
 *         task1()
 *
 *         CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
 *             task2()
 *             task3()
 *         }
 *         CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
 *             task4()
 *             task5()
 *         }
 *
 *         task6()
 *     }
 *
 *     private fun task1() { ... }
 *     private suspend fun task2() { ... }
 *     private suspend fun task3() { ... }
 *     private suspend fun task4() { ... }
 *     private suspend fun task5() { ... }
 *     private fun task6() { ... }
 * ```
