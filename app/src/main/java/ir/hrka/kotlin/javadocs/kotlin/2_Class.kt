/**
 * * A class in Kotlin can only have one primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors:
 * ```
 * class Person(val age: Int) {
 *    constructor(age: Int, name: String) : this(age) {
 *         // Do something
 *     }
 *
 *     constructor(age: Int, name: String, nationalCode: Long) :
 *     this(age, name) {
 *         // Do something
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * * A class is public and final and with a public zero-param constructor by default.
 * * The Functions of a class are final by default and must be open to overriding.
 * * The Properties of a class must be open to overriding.
 * * An open member can not be private.
 * * If a class has a primary constructor, secondary constructors must be invoke primary constructor,
 * directly or indirectly by calling another secondary constructor that the primary constructor calls.
 * * During the initialization of an instance, the initializer blocks are executed in the same order
 * as they appear in the class body, interleaved with the property initializers.
 * * Members that declared in the companion object block must be called by the class name without instantiating:
 * ```
 * class Person(val age: Int) {
 *     companion object {
 *          val MAX_AGE = 100
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Person.MAX_AGE
 *
 * val p1 = Person(10)
 * p1.age
 * ```
 * * Class members can access the private members of the corresponding companion object.
 * * After decompile in java create static final class Companion and member function of companion object
 * is declared in it and member property of companion object is declared as static final property:
 *   * To get byteCode and decompile to java code go to the bellow path in the android studio.
 * ```
 * Tools -> Kotlin -> Show Kotlin Bytecode
 * ```
