/**
 * * Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class or an interface with new functionality without
 * having to inherit from the class and This is done via special declarations called extensions.
 * * The 'this' keyword inside an extension function or getter and setter body of extension property
 * corresponds to the receiver object.
 * * If an extension is declared outside its receiver type, it cannot access
 * the receiver's private or protected members.
 * * By defining an extension, you are not inserting new members into a class,
 * only making new functions callable with the dot-notation on variables of this type.
 * * If a class has a member function, and an extension function is defined which has the same receiver type,
 * the same name, and is applicable to given arguments, the member always wins.
 * * It's perfectly OK for extension functions to overload member functions that have the same name
 * but a different signature.
 * * Since extensions do not actually insert members into classes,
 * there's no efficient way for an extension property to have a backing field.
 * This is why initializers are not allowed for extension properties.
 * * Extensions behavior can only be defined by explicitly providing getters/setters.
 * * We can call extensions on the instance of subclasses.
 * * If a class has a companion object defined, you can also define extension functions and
 * properties for the companion object.
 * * To use an extension outside its declaring package, import it at the call site.
 * * We can declare extensions as members of a class, in this way there are two implicit receivers:
 *    * Dispatch receiver: Instance of class that in which the extension is declared.
 *    * Extension receiver: Instance of class that extension declared on it.
 * * In the event of a conflict name between the members of dispatch receiver and extension receiver,
 * the extension receiver takes precedence.
 * * In extension function 'this' refer to the extension receiver and 'this@DispatchReceiver' refer
 * to the dispatch receiver.
 * * when defining an extension with a nullable receiver type, we recommend performing a this == null
 * check inside the function body to avoid compiler errors.
